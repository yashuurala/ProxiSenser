    In the realm of non-contact distance measurement, various methodologies with distinct advantages
and limitations have been developed. Microwave or laser-based systems provide extensive
measurement capabilities at the expense of reduced resolution, whereas optical and infrared
sensors offer high resolution but limited measurement ranges. But out of all of these methods,
ultrasonic sensors have proven to be an especially dependable and affordable option.
Ultrasonic Sensors, like the HC-SR04 model, are crucial for measuring distances and detecting
objects. These sensors consist of key parts that work together seamlessly. The transmitter sends out
ultrasonic waves, the receiver captures echoes from objects, and the control circuit manages
important functions like timing and noise filtering. There are four essential pins: VCC for power, TRIG
for triggering, ECHO for receiving echoes, and GND for grounding.
The basic idea is simple: the sensor sends out sound waves, which bounce back when they hit
something. By measuring how long it takes for the echoes to return, the sensor can calculate the
distance accurately. The HC-SR04 model, in particular, needs a trigger pulse to start emitting 40 kHz
ultrasound.
These sensors find wide use in robotics, automation, and industries for their precision and
versatility. The fundamental ideas and various uses of ultrasonic sensors in non-contact distance
measuring are examined in this report
