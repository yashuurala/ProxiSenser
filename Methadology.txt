1. Connect the ARM Cortex-M3 board to a PC and power supply.
2. Connectthe HC-SR04 sensor to the board using Female-to-Female jumper wires. The TRIG and ECHO
pins of the sensor are connected to port pins P0.15 and P0.16 (CNC) respectively. TheVCC and GND
pins of the sensor are connected to the respective pins on the LPC1768 board.
3. LCD module is interfaced using FRC cables (CND). Port pins P0.27 and P0.28 are used as Register
Select and Enable pins. Port pins P0.23 to P0.26 are used as Data Lines for LCD.
4. The UART, Timer, and LCD modules are initialised.
5. Configure the TRIG and ECHO pins of the sensor as input and output pins respectively.
6. Apply a short pulse for 10 microseconds on TRIG to initialise distance measurement.
7. The timer is started when the ECHO pin becomes HIGH. When the sound wave is received after
reflection from target object, the ECHO pin becomes low and the timer stops counting. The TC value
is stored in a variable.
8. Using this value the distance is computed and displayed on the LCD.
9. P1.17 is set as output pin and connected to buzzer. If the distance becomes less than 15 cm then
the buzzer is blown.
